        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I am a software engineer and media broadcaster based in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. After pursuing a computer science Masters and Bachelor's degree from the University of California, Irvine, I became a freelancer working on game projects and informational websites. My experience revolves around back-end web development and deployment using the PHP/MySQL LAMP stack and various cloud platforms. I also assist in media broadcasting as a producer or streaming assistant, utilizing software tools like OBS Studio, Voicemeeter, and VDO.Ninja to create viewing experiences for esports and podcasts.</p>
        <p>I am currently pursing full-time work as a software engineer, software support, or broadcasting support- wherever life takes me, I will pursue it! I hope you will consider me as a candidate for your next project.</p>
